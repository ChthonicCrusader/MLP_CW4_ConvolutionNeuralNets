# MLP_CW4_ConvolutionNeuralNets
This repository contains ipython files for the experiments conducted using convolution neural networks on CIFAR-10/100 dataset using Tensorflow framework. The report contains details of experiments and the results.

A reason this repo contains so many files for experiments, wheras all could have been done in a single script, is because the experiments take a long time to execute so I had to write multiple instances and run on different machines. University cluster, university machine, my friends' laptop and my laptop were some of the unfortunate hardwares that took the pain.
